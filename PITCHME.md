# If only one thing...

### Read and consider a lot, but...

### Figure out what works for you.

---

# Discuss & Coordinate with SO

### ...and your kids (if applicable)

- Set expectations
- How to signal do not disturb

---

# Work won't be a social outlet

### Find other things - sports, meetups, coffees, etc.

### But realize you also get time back\*

- Get time back, because you spend less time being interrupted or spending time on "non-work" social/chit-chat, etc., so leaves you more time in day to do what you want outside of work.

# Dont scrimp on your office

### High end chair

### Standing/movable desk (for precise height)

---

# Use video!

### Nuance and human contact are significantly improved.

### Subtle, but valuable benefits

---

# Take breaks, change up the scenery

### Easier to get/stay in the zone/flow at home

### Read outside or on your couch

### Go for a walk

---

# Notifications

### Hard balance between showing folks you're there, and not being constantly interrupted.

### Turn off email, and nearly all phone notifications.

- You don't need to know right when someone adds a photo to Insta, or posts on FB.
- Batch up email
- Slack: only notify for @ mentions, threads
- Beware of setting an expectation that you're _always_ available

# My Struggle

### Still find it hard to leave mid-afternoon.

### I prefer to exercise in the afternoon, but I am always happier when I do it in the morning, and then can work the rest of the day.
